# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
num=10
z=5
z1=3
print("Remainder: ", num%z)
print("Remainder: ", num%z1)

#3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

print(type(name))
print(type(age))

#4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80
a = 34 
b = 80
print(a>b)

# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
num1 = int(input("ENter num1: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter num2: "))
average = (num1+num2)/2
print(average)
# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
square = num1*num1
print("The square of the number is", num1**2)
print(square)
